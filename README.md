## Evaluation
### Objective Evaluation
For 10 out of 30 of the allocated project marks, students will be evaluated objectively. This part of the evaluation will merely ensure that you have implemented all of the course concepts. These should be relatively easy marks. You merely need to have any amount of code, that is not merely copied from the lab assignments (or from another source) that implements that course concept. To avoid any groups losing marks unnecessarily for this portion of the marking, a rubric has been provided in Table 2 (below):

**Requirement	Weight**  
SVG and HTML	1.0  
CSS and CSS frameworks	1.0  
JavaScript, jQuery, D3	1.5  
DHTML	1.0  
AJAX, web services	1.0  
Node.js	1.5  
Views and/or client-side framework	1.5  
Database	1.5

### Subjective Evaluation
The remaining 20 out of the 30 allocated marks will be given as an estimate of the quality and work done on the project. Factors that will be taken into consideration include non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, security, look and feel, user friendliness, code quality, design, and architecture) and functional requirements (e.g. how much work is done). Grading rubric is presented in Table 3 (below):

**Requirement	Weight**  
Code quality, design, architecture	4.0  
User interface, usability	4.0  
Work done	12.0  

**Table 3.** Subjective grading criteria

_**Note:** This project will be treated as a final exam. Accordingly, the instructor will mark the subjective portion of the project quite strictly. It is expected each student spends at least 30 hours on this project. Groups with more members, therefore, should have completed proportionally more work._

### Introduction video & independent study
Each group will record a 3-5 intro video (intro.mp4), which highlights all of the features that you've implemented in your project, including the work included from your independent study. It is crucial to include this video with your submission - not all projects work out of the box, and your video may be the only way that I can assess a functioning project. Be sure to demonstrate all of your web app's features in your video. Note - you may find it helpful to write yourself script, which you follow when recording your video (e.g., 1. show login, 2. show search, 3. show dynamic table, etc.). Please use a screen recording app to create your video, rather than a hand-held phone video.

Each group will also complete an independent study of an additional topic, not covered in any of the lectures or labs. The topic is up to you, so you can choose something that you intend to integrate into your project. You can use Node.js packages, client-side tools, data stores, web services, or some other tools not covered in the lectures. This part of the project will be worth 5 marks. You may present this as either a document (PDF), consisting of at least 500 words with images, or as a 4-5 minute intro video (h264, mp4 format or similarly common format), which highlights all of the features that you've implemented in your project, including the work included from your independent study. A rubric for the intro video and independent study is presented in Table 4 (below):

**Requirement	Weight**  
Introduction video	4.0  
Integration of new technology	1.0

### Equal Distribution of Work
With your submission, include the file "contributions.txt", which lists all students in the group, and the elements/aspects they contributed to the group project. Students who make very little contribution to the project are often evaluated separately based only on their own contributions, and normally do not receive very good mark.
